## Who are we? 
- Adam Kit
	- Research assistant at Aalto University on topic of machine learning for fusion
- Edward Kit
	- 30 year software testing guru

## What is a plasma (Brief)
- Greek for 'moldable substance' [1]
- 'Discovered' in 1920s, and first studied by Irving Langmuir [2]
	- Lagmuir used the word plasma as an analogy to blood plasma, since the transport of electrons from thermionic filaments reminded him of 'the way blood plasma carreis red and white corpuscled and germs' [3, 4]
- An gas of ions, atoms or molecules, in which the electrons are 'stripped' [5]
	- Fourth state of matter
		- Most abundunt state of matter (over 90% of the universe matter is in the plasma state) **outside of dark matter**

## Why we do we discuss? 
- Where can we find it? [See wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(physics)#cite_note-19)
	- Nature
		- Stars
		- Northern Lights
		- Lightning
		- Atmosphere (ionosphere)
	- Industrial Plasmas
		- Neon Lights 
		- Plasma processing
			- Surfaces interacting (etching, )
		- Welding
			- Temperatures of around 10,000K!
		- Plasma TVs
			- Similar to fluerscent lights -> ionized noble gasses from voltage applied across a cell -> electrons strike mercury particles, increasing energy level of mercury until excess energy shed ->UV  photons released -> photons strike phospher that is painted in the cell -> phospher molecule excited -> emits photon of visible light. 
	- Applications
		- Space
			- Ion drive
		- Food processing
			- nonthermal plasma (cold plasma)
			- antimicrobial treatment 
		- [Waste Disposal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_gasification)
			- Convert organic matter to hydrogen and CO. 
			- Reduction of CO2 emissions, compared to incinerators
			- Reduction of hazardous waste
			- No harmful emissions of toxic waste
			- Safely destroy medical and other hazardoes waste
		- [Plasma Window!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_window)
			- Two pieces of glass with plasma between them (vaccum without the vaccum since it allows most radiation to pass through which is good)
		- [Medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_medicine)
			- Disinfection
			- Dermotology
- [Fusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_power)
	- Would help solve all energy problems
	- No cost to climate
	- Very difficult
	- Different approaches to the solution
