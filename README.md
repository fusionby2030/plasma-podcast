## What is this podcast for? 
To share with the world the wonders of plasma. 
### Why
I am a plasma-physics student/researcher, and am very passionate about the subject. In my free time I would like to do more teaching, and think 30 minute podcasts are a great way to share.

## Who is this podcast for? 
The general public, english speakers, with a worldwide perspective. I think it may be somewhat biased for science people, but will try to give it a more general approach for anyone who wants to listen.
